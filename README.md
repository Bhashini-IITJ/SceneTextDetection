# SceneTextDetection
This repository provides implementations of various scene text detection models, focusing on the detection of text in images.
1. **EAST**: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03155))

# Fine-tune schema
The models in this repository have been fine-tuned on the [Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD)](https://github.com/Bhashini-IITJ/BharatSceneTextDataset), a large-scale dataset designed specifically for scene text detection tasks. The demo images used in this repository are also sourced from this dataset.
